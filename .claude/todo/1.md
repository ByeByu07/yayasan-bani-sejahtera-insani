- first see my schema, are that request good for ABAC or not? 

because the flow to make new record trasaction from request then need approval level 1 from Bendahara and level 2 from Ketua
and the flow to add/update/delete new documents from request then need approval level 1 from Sekretaris and level 2 from Ketua

- add schema for documents : this will be to save documents from request
- i want to use midtrans or xendit to handle payment when booking the room, that will be cash or transfer.
- and i use rupiah as currency so, use scale 0
- use camelCase for table name and column name
- and for shift table, i want more flexibility, how about if the workers can be more than 1?, i want just want to make the audit more secure, because the money in local place, and in the bank is different, but the summary (local + bank) is the same, so i want to make the audit more secure
